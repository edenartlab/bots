This is the full documentation, or the "Purple Paper" to the [Agartha]((https://agartha.one)) community.

The original name for this project was ‚Äî *Decentralized Future Living*. It started as a workshop at [Mars College](https://mars.college/), 2022.

Inspired by existing co-living communities that are re-inventing and re-defining new ways of living, learning and loving together, along with the [Solarpunk Protopian](https://www.notion.so/The-Solarpunk-Movement-81a6817055514eb9831bb0804b122402?pvs=21) movement of creating a positive future where advanced technologies are used to serve harmonious living between humans and nature, we decided to summarize what we spent months researching and learning into an online identity ‚Äî Agartha.

For now, our Community Map works as a gate for the curious internet explorers to discover the global landscape of ‚Äòmeaningful communities‚Äô which includes:

- Artist residencies
- Intentional coliving projects
- Eco villages
- A hybrid of above all

### The Meaning of Agartha

Legends tell that there‚Äôs a Utopia underneath the south pole called Agartha.

There‚Äôs also a story about general [Admiral Byrd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Byrd)‚Äôs [expedition to the south pole after WW2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EG4CAHQOJQwsYiiokNncSJi6KBFGhvxg/view?usp=sharing). Supposedly he discovered Jurassic-era lush jungles and an advanced alien species who told Byrd to bring one message back to the surface of earth, that: 

*Earth is at the threat of destroying itself with the amount of militarization and nuclear weapons at hand. If your species can agree to de-nuclear yourself, we would come greet you and share our knowledge and technologies with you.*

It is beyond our capacity to argue whether the story is true or not, whether Agartha exist or not.

The meaning of Agartha stands in the beautiful metaphor of this story, that a better world is possible, it is quite simple, and the possibilities are hidden right under the surface. 

We‚Äôd like to position ourselves philosophically at the intersection of learning from ancient wisdom and developing modern technology to serve mankind‚Äôs overall wellbeing.

The greater mission for Agartha is to act as a gate to unearth ancient wisdoms with modern day technologies, act as a missing link to coordinate different grass root subculture communities through shared commonalities. 

We have all the answers, we just need to bring them to the right people, at the right place and the right time.

The design of our logo represents an eye within a teardrop to symbolize that: the Universe is always watching us, and it cries for all the pains and sufferings humanity has to go through in order to evolve, progress and build a better future.

We don‚Äôt live in a utopia because we are here to figure out how to build it.

*To Mother Nature and Our Fractal Universe*

### Ethos

We spent a lot of time thinking about bringing positive impact to our modern world, what does that look like? How does it work? It‚Äôs societal and technological innovation as well as emotional and moral retrospectives. Here is a summary of important ethos for this project.

### Community First

We believe in the power of networks, and humans are born to support and help each others. We‚Äôre rallying a community of freedom seekers, critical thinkers and regenerative leaders to meet, support and learn from each others, to team up and explore solutions together.

Find a community to visit on our [Map](https://www.agartha.one/map) or join our Discord to say Hi!

### Techno-Centric

Automation empowers us and simplification liberates us.

We want to support a community of solution driven, techno-centric innovators and providing them the community they need.

### **Earth as a Player**

Counting earth as a player in our economy is not a political opinion, it‚Äôs survival.

We believe a sustainable future starts from reinventing the way we live, such as adopting local energy systems, permaculture food gardens and re-wilding deserts. Just one person planting trees everyday could turn dry lands to an oasis, imagine if we do it together.

### Individual Sovereignty

A better future is when individuals have sovereignty over themselves to pursuit who they really want to be. It is a brave and daunting struggle towards owning one‚Äôs own sovereignty.

A lot of the communities we list provide inspiring solutions to alternative lifestyles with a great support network, so that we can grow and choose to be sovereign individuals, but not alone.

### Playfulness

Tasks can all be a lot more joyful if we turn them into fun games. We feel safe and cheerful if our culture can be safe and cheerful, and that all comes from the art of play! 

Many places provide a psychologically ‚Äòsafe‚Äô environment for its dwellers to really explore their inner children. When we have a space to get away from socio-economical pressure of toxic productivities, and truly create, produce and learn playfully, we most likely would get to create magic, and enjoy it too.

### The Social Movement

*Eco Village + Technology + Regeneration ‚Üí Communal, Innovative, Ecological*

A few shinning examples of Solarpunk builders:

[Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com/) ‚Äî the first Land-based DAO in Europe

[Future Thinkers](https://futurethinkers.org/) ‚Äî a GameB Smart Village in Canada

[Mars College](https://mars.college/) ‚Äî a Desert High-tech Transient Camp-Building Co-living Skill-share Project in California

**A larger archive of these communities can be found on [Regen Library](https://www.notion.so/Regen-Library-c3ca587347594684b3b744bcb0c9f2f0?pvs=21)*

### Keys to Building Solarpunk Communities

*individualüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Üí communityüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ ‚Üí societyüèò ‚Üí earthüåç*

Shelter:

- Sustainable Building Materials

Water:

- Rain Catchment + Well Water
- Grey Water Filtration System

Food:

- Permaculture & Agroforestry
- Local Food Garden
- Efficient Farming: Hydroponics, Aquaponics, Aeroponics

Waste:

- Upcycle Materials (paper, plastic)
- Avoid Single Use Materials
- Compost (biogas, biomiller, etc‚Ä¶)

*Not only Solarpunk lifestyles can be close to Zero Emission, it can even regenerate local climates by tree-planting and water trapping.*

For example, [Auroville](https://auroville.org/) has [planted more than 3 million trees since 1968 onwards](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/forests/how-auroville-can-teach-us-all-a-thing-or-two-about-offsetting-carbon-81331), and created a green belt of 1380 acres in India.
