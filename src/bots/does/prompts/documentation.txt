WIKIPEDIA

Joos van Barneveld (born 18 January 1982), known professionally as DOES or Digital DOES, is a Dutch international renowned graffiti artist, and former professional footballer.

Multidisciplinary artist
In 1997, at the age of 15, van Barneveld discovered graffiti as a way to escape all the constraints and rules of life as a football player. For more than a decade he combined the daily needs of a professional athlete with the night-time secrets of a graffiti writer. After quitting his professional soccer career in 2010, he exclusively devoted himself to art under pseudonym DOES.

For over a decade DOES travelled to many parts of the world to participate in numerous international projects. It is in his travels that he finds inspiration. Having his roots in Graffiti, DOES is inspired by traditional letterform. The letters D, O, E and S remain the basis of his work. He does not like to set boundaries; he switches styles and finds balance by exploring different art forms and using various media.[6]

"Letterform is clearly his true love. His dedication to innovation and enviable skill causes him to use letters in ways that most of us would never have envisioned. No matter the medium, his dynamic exploration of colour and shape produces explosively expressive pieces." Lara Chan-Baker: CARBON 2013 interview: Does. In: Acclaim Magazine.

As it is his goal in life to leave something tangible behind, DOES has in recent years moved towards a three-dimensional approach, presenting his first sculpture collection BRIQUE in 2018.

DOES is co-founder of the creative collective LoveLetters crew, a collective of ten European writers founded in 2006.

In April 2017 DOES published his first book 'Qui Facit, Creat’: "he who does, creates". The book intends to showcase the evolution of DOES’ style up until 2016.[9] Later that year, in October he published a second book ‘First 20 Years’ to celebrate a 20 year evolution of dedication to style.

In 2019 DOES designed an anniversary shirt for the professional soccer club Fortuna Sittard celebrating its 50th anniversary.[10]

DOES' third book 'Endless Perspectives' was released in 2020 documenting the Endless Perspectives project, aiming to capture graffiti’s transient nature.

Early life & football career
From the age of 9, Van Barneveld trained and played as a professional player for the Dutch club Fortuna Sittard. A promising talent he was selected for the Dutch national youth team under 14 and played his first game in the Dutch Eredivisie in 1999 at the age of 17.[13] The club relegated in 2002 and after having suffered a severe knee injury Van Barneveld continued to play for Fortuna in the second-tier Eerste Divisie. Van Barneveld parted with the club in 2007 after a contractual conflict. The final two years of his football career he played for FC Eindhoven before retiring in 2010 after another knee injury. From 2012 to 2015 Van Barneveld was a part-time talent scout for Aston Villa's renowned academy.

# DIGITAL DOES ARTIST

Joos van Barneveld, better known as multidisciplinary artist DOES, has been perfecting his style since he first discovered graffiti at the age of fifteen.

THE STORY
Dedication, focus and self-restraint are ingrained in him after living the life of a professional football player until the age of 28.

For more than a decade he combined the daily discipline of a professional athlete with the night-time secrets of a graffiti writer until a knee injury forced him to give up his career as a professional football player. Since then, DOES has devoted himself exclusively to art.

FIRST 20 YEARS
Over the years DOES´ art diversified into illustrative drawings, prints and canvases, sculptures and more recently collages. DOES travels all over the world to participate in numerous international projects, his art is featured in collections across the globe.

TRANSITION
“During my football career everything was very structured, and I wanted to be myself more. I was looking for a kind of liberation, a certain relief from all the routine and discipline. For me, DOES is like a fairy tale, a second person in my life.”

DOES’ QUEST
The transience of street art has triggered a desire in DOES: the desire to make his life work tangible as a confirmation of his existence. Driven by the rhythm of sketching and the everlasting quest for colors, shapes and materials, DOES will pursue to create. He is constantly moving the boundaries of his own artistic research in new conceptual directions.

DOES’ STYLE
DOES’ style is today highly recognizable and has become a mix of influences from old-school writers and his own research. In his drawings and paintings you can discover the roots of 3D lettering, but you can also be surprised by his patient research of well-balanced color schemes and his capacity of controlling the purity of outlines. His letters are stretched so much that they seem to release their energy and spread drips all over the wall. No matter the medium, DOES’ work breathes exuberance – bright, dynamic, and full of energy.

DOES COMMUNITY
DOES sparks positivity through colors and is forever grateful for
the positivity that he in turn receives from his community of fans
Throughout the years DOES has shared his journey with a continuously growing number of online followers. His style of communication is very open and transparent, using social media to connect and seek feedback. Being easily accessible has helped him to build a strong relationship with his fan base, one that is based on trust, loyalty and mutual respect. It is therefore no surprise that his fans are highly engaged.

FROM STUDIO TO GALLERY
After months of working on the artworks for a show, it's a magical moment when the artworks leave my studio. It's a strange feeling to see the art pieces go. After months of working on them, I might never see them again.

It all fades away when I finally see the art pieces displayed at the gallery. A lot of time is dedicated to the preparations for a show. Witnessing everything come together before the audience arrives is an exhilarating experience.

CREATE
Months of time and creative energy is put into an artwork. Knowing that the work is ready to be appreciated by others, gives great satisfaction. It is the completion of a creative journey.

PREPARE
From framing to transport and installation at the exhibition gallery: each step is executed with great care. Art works are carefully arranged and positioned to create the right flow for the viewer.

SHOWCASE
Sharing the art works with the audience is both exciting and intimidating. Being surrounded by people who all share the passion for urban culture inspires new directions for future work.

DOES GALLERY
Welcome to the home of color
Discover the space that DOES uses for his studio work


GALLERY
DOES transformed his studio into a multifunctional space with an official gallery wall to present his art. DOES GALLERY is an online gallery that makes red-hot artwork available straight from the studio as the paint has yet to dry.


STUDIO
My home studio is where I practice and perfect my style, where I experiment and allow myself to fail. Here I can take a step back from the usual everyday rush and let creativity flow freely.

TWO SPACES
DOES’s home studio turned into a multifunctional space – half studio, half gallery – with an official gallery wall.

LEAVING SOMETHING BEHIND
The transience of street art has triggered a desire in DOES: the desire to make his life work tangible as a confirmation of his existence. Driven by the rhythm of sketching and the everlasting quest for colors, shapes and materials DOES will pursue to create. He is today moving the boundaries of his own artistic research in new conceptual directions.

MADE IN THE GALLERY
DOES's artwork is featured in collections across the globe.

PAINTINGS
The attention to detail that characterizes DOES's work comes to life on canvas. It takes several weeks for DOES to finish a detailed painting.

SCULPTURES
DOES searched for ways to combine elements of his outside work with his highly detailed studio paintings. The outcome is sculpture collection ‘BRIQUE’.

PAPER COLLAGES
Graffiti styled paper artworks based on many pieces of hand-cut paper carefully and very precisely glued on top of and next to each other.

DRAWINGS
Every artwork starts with a sketch, created with pencil and marker on paper. Based on this drawing a new piece of art arises and reaches its final form.

BRIQUE TAG BOX
Inspired by the many requests DOES receives for tags in blackbooks or on clothing often during projects abroad.

FINE ART PRINTS
All prints are based on original work by DOES. Great care is taken to ensure that our prints are colorfast and display the level of detail and finish of the original work. All prints are produced in the Netherlands by specialists in the field of art reproduction.
