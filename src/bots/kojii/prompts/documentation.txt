Kojii is a co-creativity lab that supports an AI-enabled artistic experience built on Avalanche & Ethereum. Its goal is to create the internet’s most simple and ownership focused AI toolbox for personal imagination, curiosity, and expression. The Kojii project exists so that people all over the world can explore artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies in a creative, spiritual, and emotionally poignant way. It was created to unlock a new age of self-curated AI to empower all aspects of human creativity. Kojii enables a conversation between artist and collector via a generative model.

Kojii curates artists and works with them to create generative models that reflect their work, and a set of parameters that define the boundaries of the outputs.  Collectors engage with the model and its parameters to generate unique artworks via credits, and they can then immortalize images as NFTs on AVAX or ETH.

## What is the Platform of kojii.ai?

Kojii beta offers a ‘playground’ comprised of AI artist’s models that users can experiment with. In short: the beta will be a blend of fx(hash) and civit.ai – a friendly and simple interface for users to customize and mint from AI models.

The objective is to create a consumer experience with AI models, and an ecosystem of curated AI Art NFTs. These together will be a backbone for a further body of AI and blockchain experimentation which can automate further.

## What are the Features of kojii.ai beta?

1. A subscription service that will be tiered to reflect various price points and commitment of the user. Subscription tier will reflect the user’s ability to mint on the platform.

2. We will sell a fixed number of mint passes which are each equivalent to a subscription service. People can freely trade mint passes as well. Mint passes have a fixed number of credits associated with their tiers.

3. kojii beta begins with 9 AI Models (diffusion models) by 9 AI Artists that have created a specific story, aesthetic, or concept with the model.

4. Users can play with the AI models; however, each model will have a maximum of 999 mints.

5. Once the user has minted a model, they can use credits attached to their subscription tier to play with all models.

Kojii beta will also feature 1 special artist AI model drop a month with more curation, storytelling, focus on narrative.

## How does kojii.ai work?

Kojii is an inference engine. Users will interact with an artist’s models by customizing parameters in the engine, and optionally uploading their own initial images to be modified. We will harness Eden for the interface infrastructure.

About Eden: [Eden](https://eden.art) is a generative AI platform created by [Gene Kogan](https://twitter.com/genekogan) and [Xander Steenbrugge](https://twitter.com/xsteenbrugge), which bootstraps a new generation of sovereign applications that are mutually composable and interoperable. Eden accomplishes this via an open-source full-stack platform for deploying your own custom model servers, and a decentralized, web3-based user account model.

## What is the Mission of kojii.ai?

Create the internet’s most simple and ownership focused AI toolbox for personal imagination, curiosity, and expression.

## Who are the artists on kojii.ai?

## Why were the artists on kojii.ai selected?

Our artists build worlds through custom models which become playgrounds for you to experiment, create and collect. The artists selected for kojii.ai possess unique abilities to imagine and visualize worlds, concepts, philosophies or any other abstracted idea of reality. In this way, many of them are multi-disciplinary and undefined minds that do not seek labels as “visual artist” “technologist” “sculptor” “photographer” “performer.” We believe that an emerging human phenomena, artificial intelligence as a tool, requires these genre-breaking minds to itself improve and truly propagate a positive technological culture [as opposed to a bureaucratic or enforced one]. 

## How will kojii.ai evolve overtime?

* As the project evolves, we will open up the core AI Model/NFT engine to all global artists. We plan to expand features of the engine itself so that fine-tuning, LoRAs & other customization practices become broader for different file-types and imaginations.. 
* We plan to foster collaboration across the artistic, technological, and scientific communities. We imagine allowing multiple users to contribute to and co-create unique pieces.
* We will provide more resources and education materials to help users, both artists and collectors, understand the nuances of AI in art creation and blockchain technology.

We prioritize community feedback!

## What is AI Artistry?

“What is AI art” remains an open question for the public. Those of us that seek humanistic, aesthetic, emotional interrogation via the stories and visuals will find “art” organically. Defining its condition pre-emptively in order to find comfort in control of the art narrative will not work. 

Artists have used AI in many different ways for the last +6 years. The artist’s process differs by their choice and their skill level in different arenas. Here are three common processes for artists who use AI to create: 

* First, via coding. Artists fine-tune or create niche models (LLMs, Diffusion, GANs) themselves. They take time to train the model towards certain aesthetics or subject matter, but they do not constrain the output to one single version.
* Second, Human-machine collaboration. Artists feed certain datasets or fine-tuning into specific models in order to achieve a desired image, video, 3D object etc. Their goal is to highlight the interactivity taking place and the resulting
* Third, Prompting. Artists develop descriptive text-based prompts that are rendered by text-to-image models with distinct visual concepts and text that serve as titles of the art piece.

“AI Artists” with deeper practices mostly use Diffusion models, however, a few like to maintain the relatively ancient feel and aesthetic of GANs. 

## About our artists

**Vanessa Rosa** is a US-based Brazilian visual artist whose work merges physical and digital media into a storytelling continuum. Murals become portals to an imaginary world with projection mapping and ceramics metamorphose into living entities with the aid of AI models. She creates fictional tales about world history, where past and possible futures intertwine.

**Makeitrad** is a Los Angeles based designer and pixel manipulator whose work examines finding the organic beauty of Nature while being trapped in a world of technology. He often uses artificial intelligence and machine learning but also embraces ideas of randomness and noise to drive the final forms. With his incredible ability to find inspiration through the lens of a child, the result is insightful and inspiring artwork that is also vibrant, innocent, and fun.

**Tom Furse** is a cultural multi-hyphenate with a long history in and around music with The Horrors since 2005. Since 2021 he has developed a world-leading creative AI practice with his art and audiovisual work bringing him into a wide range of new spaces and collaborations including the V&A, Sonar, Wedgwood, Stevie Nicks and Charles Jeffrey Loverboy.

**Kirk Finkel [untitled, xyz]** is a Brooklyn-based artist and virtual architect. His work investigates metaverse architecture through modular design concepts with a focus on virtual art galleries and public spaces. Prior to xyz, he practiced as an urban designer in New York. Kirk is the Director of Architecture at the Museum of Crypto Art. He holds a master's degree in urban design (MsAUD) from Columbia University and a bachelor's of architecture (BArch) from Cornell University.

**Alex Headlam or Aleqth** is a multi-disciplinary artist based in New York. He creates art that straddles the real and the imaginary.
